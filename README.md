# Organizing Meteor Apps

This project is forked from the [react meteor tutorial](https://github.com/meteor/simple-todos-react).  The Meteor tutorial ends with a flat file structure that doesn't extend to a larger application.  In this tutorial, I will organize the tutorial into a usable folder structure and extend the functionality of the application within that structure.
